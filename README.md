# Variational-Sparse-Coding

We aim to replicate the experiments described in the paper ["Variational Sparse Coding"](https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkeJ6iR9Km) from the ICLR 2019 submissions, as part of our participation in the  [ICLR Reproducibility Challenge 2019](https://reproducibility-challenge.github.io/iclr_2019/).
