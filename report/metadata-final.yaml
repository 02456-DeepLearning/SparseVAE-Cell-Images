abstract: "In this work we replicate and validate the experiments described in the paper 
           'Variational Sparse Coding' submitted to the ICLR 2019 Conference. Aiming to 
           reproduce the results obtained by the authors, we implemented from scratch the 
           variational auto-encoder architecture as described in the submitted paper to 
           learn sparse representations for MNIST, Fashion-MNIST and CelebA datasets. We 
           run the experiments and propose further suggestions to improve model performance 
           at generating samples from low-dimensional vectors, traversing latent space, and 
           using the sparse representations for classification tasks. We conclude that 
           reproducibility, given the paper description, is overall possible."
